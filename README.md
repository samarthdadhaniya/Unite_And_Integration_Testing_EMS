# Employee Management System
> This project is about testing an Employee Management System (EMS) using Java, JUnit, and Mockito in IntelliJ IDEA. The system manages employees, calculates payroll, and checks performance.

The Employee Management System (EMS) was tested to make sure all parts of the software work correctly. Unit testing was done for small parts like employee records and payroll calculations to check if each feature works properly on its own. This helped find simple mistakes like wrong salary calculations or missing employee data.

Integration testing was done to see how different modules work together. It checked how payroll and attendance systems shared data and handled errors when many employees were processed at once. These tests made sure the system works smoothly without crashing or showing wrong results.

Some issues were found, like null values, attendance percentage errors, and slow report generation. After fixing them, the system became more stable and reliable.

Overall, the testing process improved the quality of the Employee Management System. It ensured that the software runs smoothly, handles data correctly, and gives accurate results to users.
